# UnorderedLinkedList
Development of a Unordered Linked List and an Ordered Linked List which grades objects based on their Priority of value (Whichever was entered first), and then removes them from the List based on said value. Project developed inorder to see the runtime and optimization of both approaches of data organizing and manipulating.

Abstraction created based on a PriorityQueue<E> object, which Professor held all functions within.

Formerly these projects were located on a ssh, thus the files are uploaded as txt files.
